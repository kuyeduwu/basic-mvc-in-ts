# Basic MVC in TS

I'm learning TypeScript from the book [Learning TypeScript](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0151N0G7W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&keywords=learning%20typescript&language=en_US&qid=1571747146&sr=8-1) written by Remo H. Jansen, the book itself is good, just the version I have is based on TypeScript 1.5, some of the samples are outdated, especially the final MVC sample.

What am doing here is trying to update this great sample to current TS version (3.6).

# Done
 - Update all dependencies.
 - Update tasks in gulp config.
 - Update the decorators for `view` and `model`.
# TODO
 - [ ] Update `view`, `model`, `controller` to use `abstract class` provide in TS.
